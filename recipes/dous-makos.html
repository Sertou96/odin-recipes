  <img class="dous-makos-pic" src="../Dous_Makos-5.jpg">

  <p>Dous Makos is a type of fudge originating from <strong>Petit-Goave, Haiti.</strong> The dessert typically contains 3 signature stripes a light colored vanilla layer, a chocolate layer, and a red layer made using food coloring.</p>

  <p>The candy has many different types of flavors such as chocolate, vanilla, almonds, peanut butter, citrus, etc. In this recipe we'll be making the traditional <strong>vanilla</strong> version.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 Cups of sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 Cups of Whole Milk</li>
    <li>1 Can of sweetened condensed milk (14 ounces)</li>
    <li>8 Tbs of butter</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of Anise star extract</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of cinnamon</li>
    <li>Red Food Coloring (Optional red layer)</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of cocoa powder (Optional Dark brown layer)</li>
    <li>wax paper</li>
    <li>mini loaf pans</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>In a 3 quart non-stick pot, add all ingredients (except food coloring and cocoa power) and cook on medium heat until sugar dissolves while constantly stirring.</li>

    <li>Once sugar dissolves, raise heat to high and continue stirring for 20 - 25 min or until mix has a lava consistency. If you have a candy thermometer it will be around 115 Â°C.</li>

    <li>Remove the pot off the heat and continue stirring for another 10-15 min. The mix will start to lose its shinny color as it cools.</li>
    <li><strong>OPTIONAL -</strong> If you want to make the signature stripes, take half the mix and separate the half into 2 containers. Add 2 drops of food coloring in the first and a 1/4 tsp of coca powder in the second. Mix the thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Place wax paper in the mini loaf pans and fill it with the mix.</li>
    <li>Allow the mix to cool and harden for about an hour.</li>
    <li>Store in a cool place.</li>
  </ol>
